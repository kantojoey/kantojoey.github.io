I am a graduate of Washington University in St. Louis, earning a B.A. in Environmental Biology with an additional minor in French. On campus I worked as the first GIS Specialist for the Office of Sustainability, analyzing campus spatial data to assist with annual campus sustainability reporting. Previously, I served as the director for the Washington University Green Ambassadors and President of the Student Environmental Council, two groups which work closely with the Office of Sustainability and other student groups to create and bring to life exciting sustainability projects on campus. As an undergraduate, I also carried out field research in South Africa focusing on South African ecology and conservation in Kruger National Park. I currently work in the Geospatial Analysis field while concurrently taking part in an intensive software development training program gaining knowledge of powerful languages and frameworks like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and Java. I hope to build these skills to begin a new career in tech that lends itself to my interests and ensures opportunities for continued professional growth.
